# AISim: A reservoir simulator embedded with a neural network-based relative permeability curve

Why I upload .py directly without creating bin, src, etc?

I want to have more audiences. Those who are super experienced coders can easily access my work, but for those who learn how to code from the Internet, especially some YouTubers. I believe the best way is to show the code plainly.
So download ZIP please, click on main.py
