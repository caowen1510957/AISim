Why I upload .py directly without creating bin, src, etc?
Why do I upload .py directly without making it bin, src, etc? I want to have more audiences. Those who are super experienced coders can easily access my work, but for those who learn how to code from the Internet, especially some YouTubers. I believe the best way is to show the code plainly.
